Trouble in Paradise


Trouble in Paradise
 
			SEQUENCE A 

FADE IN  NIGHT
  
MED. SHOT   DOOR OF A HOUSE   
A cheap residential district. The house has no architectural 
character; it is not certain where we are. Near the entrance 
door is a garbage can, full.

A dog is nibbling at some of the garbage. We hear whistling, 
footsteps. A garbage man comes into the picture. He shoos 
the dog away. Without pause in whistling, he lifts the 
garbage can and, followed by camera, goes to the end of the 
block, which is only a few steps. Now we discover we are in 
Venice. In the background is a major canal and a typical 
bridge--romantic background. Gondolas are passing. In the 
foreground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola, piled 
high with garbage. The man dumps his load, leaves the empty 
can on the sidewalk, gets in the gondola, and paddles away

Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round



Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round 
1               CREDIT TITLES reach the screen--superimposed 
                on a background of steaming funnels belching 
                steam--accompanied by a musical score of ex-
                citing tempo.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

2               LONG SHOT--NIGHT
                Large ocean liner, plowing through darkened 
                waters, its decks and portholes brilliantly 
                illuminated.

                                        CUT TO: 

3               QUICK FLASH--MEDIUM SHOT--PROW OF SHIP 
                Coming straight onto the CAMERA. The speed at
                which she is traveling throws a phosphorescent 
                spray many feet into the air--almost up to the 
                bowsprit, under which is carved, in ornate letters, 
                S. S. Progress.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

Nothing But A Man




A crew of African-Americans are laying tracks in rural Alabama. The crane 
operator is the only white man on the section gang.

INT. BUNK CAR
The dormitory of the section gang. The men are through for the day and 
lounging on their bunkbeds. DUFF ANDERSON plays checkers with FRANKIE, using 
bottle tops as pieces. Duff makes the winning move and Frankie, disgusted, 
turns over the board. He saunters over to JOCKO, who is shaving in a broken 
mirror. Frankie watches him with a grin.

			JOCKO  
	Go to hell, Frankie.

			FRANKIE  
	Man, you sure one ugly cat!

He takes the cigarettes Jocko has rolled, sailor-style, into the sleeve of 
his T-shirt.

			JOCKO  
	Why don't you guys buy your own?

			FRANKIE  
	'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.

He stops in front of an older man, who is writing a letter.

			FRANKIE  
	How much longer we got on this stretch, Riddick?

			RIDDICK 
	Five weeks, maybe six.

			FRANKIE  
	Man, what a dump.

He circles restlessly past two ca"

In the pitch darkness of an old shivery east coast cellar, the audience sits amongst SILENCE. Then... Rising from the THEATRE'S REAR SPEAKERS...faint tiny claws, many, moving as one, scuttle; seemingly in the roof of the THEATRE. CHEWING. SCRATCHING. TEARING.
An elderly woman, shrill and startling, calls out in the

Willard!

There are rats in the basement!
The scuttling stops. Silence. Beat; another, then...a metal doorknob, distinctive to a classic antiquated house, CLACKS and echoes. O.S., A door slowly squeaks open.
From an upstairs room, a rhomboidal patch of light creeps across the TOP RIGHT OF FRAME. Within the light holds the hesitant shadow of an average sized man at the summit of a flight of stairs, descending into a cold, dark cellar.

O.S., a light switch FLIPS. A FLASH! An exaggerated POP! The light bulb blows in the f.g., a fuse-box CRACKLES, sprays t"

Plaza
March 29, 1971						 New York, New York 10019





INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
simple words in white lettering:

					  THE GODFATHER

While this remains, we hear: ""I believe in America.""
Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
emotion.

					BONASERA
			America has made my fortune.

As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

					BONASERA
			I raised my daughter in the American
			fashion; I gave her freedom, but
			taught her never to dishonor her

THE EXORCIST



EXTERIOR- IRAQ- EXCATVATION SITE- NINEVEH- DAY 

Pickaxes and shovels weld into the air as hundreds of excavators 
tear at the desert. The camera pans around the area where 
hundreds of Iraqi workmen dig for ancient finds. The caption 
Northern Iraq appears at the bottom of the screen as the digging 
continues. The camera then follows a young boy running bare foot 
over the rocky mounds. He comes to a stop and the camera is 
positioned in between the boys legs looking at and aging man also 
digging. 

YOUNG BOY
(In Iraqi language)
They've found something... small pieces. 

MERRIN
(In Iraqi language)
Where? 

YOUNG BOY
(In Iraqi language)
At the base of the mound. 

The boy runs off and the old man pulls himself to his feet to 
follow. The old man walks to the base of the mound where another 
man who looks in command is there to greet him. 

MAN
(In Iraqi language)
Some interesting finds. Lamps, arrow-heads, coins"

	On a distant, rainy hill, the old Frankenstein castle, as

				KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER



					Screenplay
						by
					Robert Benton



			Based on the novel by Avery Corman



				Revised Third Draft
					July 14, 1978


----------------------------------------------------------------

	FADE IN:

1	INT. OFFICE, ADVERTISING AGENCY, MIDTOWN - EVENING

	WIDE SHOT--A large and very comfortable office over-
	looking St. Patrick's Cathedral.  At the moment the
	office is filled to bursting with men and women, slumped
	in chairs, sitting on desks, all of them very tense.
	Among the crowd of people we note:  MURRAY FISHER, a
	young and very ambitious junior executive and PHYLLIS
	BERNARD, an attractive woman in her early thirties.
	She is a lawyer with the agency.

	At the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being
	what you would call a matinee idol, paces back and
	forth.  His tie is loosened, he checks his watch every
	fifteen seconds.  Clearly he is very distraught.

					 Written by

				   Lawrence Kasdan 

					    and 

				    Leigh Brackett

				   From a story by

					George Lucas

EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH

A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots 
from its underside.  

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of
impact.  

EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A 
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the 
smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the 
snow plain and disappears into the distance.

EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY

A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled 
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving 
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged 
beast.

The rider ga"

              FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3: 3D


              FADE IN:
 
              TITLE AND CREDITS
 
              A piercing high note is sustained on the soundtrack as the
              main title, ""CRYSTAL JAPAN"" speeds straight at the audience
              in 3-D and seems to jump right out at them.
 
              The opening credits follow.  Ominous theme music fills the
              soundtrack, growing darker and more dissonant.
 
              The theme music slowly dissolves into the sound of a radio
              news broadcast, as the credits continue to unfold.
 
                                  RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        ...and I'm Ed Harris with the KLTZ

				MICHAEL KANE

				AND

				RICHARD MATHESON



revised first draft, 8/10/82


					   JAWS 3-D



	FADE IN:

1	AN UNDERWATER WONDERLAND						1

	Crystal green.  Beautiful fish of all colors and
	faces swarm happily by.  A spectacular undersea garden
	blooms like plants touched by springtime.  A quick-
	silver surface of color mirrors lush reef growth.


2	SURREALISTIC CREATURES							2

	Swim, creep, crawl, stalk, hide in their endless
	quest to survive.


3	FISH									3

	A beautiful aquarium of peace and tranquility.


4	TERROR									4

	The fish suddenly explode in panic, darting in all
	different directions, swimming instinctively for
	their threatened lives.


5	GROUPER									5

	300 pounds.  Awesome and ugly, swimming away as fast
	as it can go.


6	ANOTHER ANGLE - GROUPER							6

	As we come closer on it.
	Closer.
	It glances back, eyes wide with fear of impending death.
	It reverses course, ATTACKING CAMERA, and the grouper
	gets


7	TORN IN HAL"

"The Black Cauldron
Prologue
Legend has it, in the mystic land of Prydain. There was once a king so cruel, and so evil, that even the gods feared him. Since no prison could hold him, he was thrown alive into a crucible of moltin iron. There his demonic spirit was captured, in the form of a great black cauldron. For uncounted centuries The Black Cauldron lay hidden, while evil men searched for it. Knowing whoever possessed it, would have the power to resurrect an army of deathless warriors. And with them, rule the world.
The Black Cauldron
At Caer Dallben.......
Dallben: There's something wrong! I can feel it in my bones. Hmm, the Fairfolk know it too. You don't see any of them around! The Horned King! That black hearted devil! What's he waiting for? ( the tomcat jumps in front of him and meows ) YES, yes, Cat, I KNOW you want your breakfast! But just now THINKING is more important! Oh,Taran! The pot is boiling over, Taran!

TITLES ROLL:

CLOSE ON a finely-worked Medieval tapestry.  In the
background, beyond the intricate foliage, stands a moated
castle where a troop of mounted hunters set out for the
chase with dogs and lances.  In the foreground, a lovely
young maiden heads for the forest, carrying an armful of
flowers.  The forest, stylistically rendered by the
weaver's art, has numbers of small animals cunningly
worked into the warp and woof.  A Green Man, clad only in
leaves and vines, hides behind a tree, watching a stately
pair of unicorns grazing on the greensward.

TITLES END:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Writer:   I was twelve going on thirteen first time I saw a dead human being. 
	  It happened in the summer of nineteen-fifty-nine. A long time ago.
	  But only if you measure in terms of years.
	  I was living in a small town in Oregon called Castle Rock. There were

Radio:    Hey it's the bossman Bob Cormier here. It's a beautiful Friday

		     We move over some junk -- the 
		     rusting front end of an automobile...
		     We're going somewhere...

		     The water becomes shallow and we

back and forth in the wind. 

CLOSE ON: 

A half finished barn. A tumbleweed blows by the screen.

CLOSE ON: 

A scarecrow with a pumpkin for a head. It sits on a

A Halloween style weathervane.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT - RAINING

An ambulance appears in the distance, it's headlights

The Magic Toyshop


The Magic Toyshop
 
1. 	Exterior. A London square. Night.

   	But a shabby square. Wet and misty, creating a halo 
	around a street lamp - an old-fashioned, gas one, the 
	period is circa 1954/5. The mist partially obscures 
	the surroundings. Out of the mist emerges a man, 
	gaunt, raw-boned, in a soiled trenchcoat open over a 
	shabby, ill-fitting suit. His five o'clock shadow is 
	just showing. His thoughts are worlds away from his 
	surroundings. His age is indeterminate, anything from 
	mid-twenties to mid-forties.
   
	He is heading towards the row of shops on one side of 
	the square: fog hides the square itself but the 
	outlines of one or two trees are visible - the 
	diffused light from the street lamp illuminates some 
	leaves.
   
	The shops comprise a greengrocer's - as FRANCIE 
	approaches, a woman in a blue overall reaches out and 
	pulls down a blind, hiding the piled fruit; and a 
	butcher - closed, nothing in the window but 
	greaseproof paper"

Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he

He wants to leave things on a good note.

Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new

But you never had a first date.

Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We

Beauty and the Beast
The Complete Script

Compiled by Ben Scripps <34rqnpq@cmuvm.csv.cmich.edu>

NARRATOR:     Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a
              shining castle.  Although he had everything his heart desired,

              the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not

              melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.  The prince

LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her

pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her
shift.  She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter
into a bus tray underneath the counter.  It is making a
lot of RACKET, which she is oblivious to.  There is
COUNTRY MUZAK in the b.g., which she hums along with.

THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming

We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a
splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large

FADE IN:

1	EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Flying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at
spitting distance from the treetops.  We're in central
Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.

A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the

	A legend tries to place us - -

	It's quiet for a second.  A ROAR rises up from the jungle, 
	deafening.  The trees shake as something very, very large plows ahead 
	through them, right at us.  Every head gathered in this little clearing

	It's a bulldozer.  It drops its scoop and pushes forward into

1	TITLES - The sound of a woman walking on a deserted street

2	EXT NIGHT STREET - FADE UP - We see a woman's feet wearing red stiletto
	shoes. It is late at night and she is very alone.

	She turns a bend and enters a darkened street, her heels making a
	distinctive click on the path.

	Suddenly we see a figure in the darkness - the womans pauses for a beat
	before continuing. She approaches the figure who is dressed in a heavy
	motorbike jacket... The figure turns round - it is a girl with bleached
	blonde hair, wearing a low cut, tight white T Shirt. The white seems to
	glow a little.

	Without warning, the WOMAN produces a hammer from her bag and raises it
	above BLONDE...

	Screams....

	FADE TO BLACK - TITLES


3	EXT NIGHT PARK - The young BLONDE lies motionless on the floor, most of
	her clothes ripped from her still body. The sound of digging can be
	heard, then of a knife being unsheathed.

	Her body is dragged out of shot...

     LEON
     aka The Professional

     Version 1 Script

     from an original idea by Luc Besson

     Notes:
     The beginning is identical to the movie, so we considered 
     useless reporting it here.  It's from Mathilda's first rifle 
     training scene that the original script is totally different 
     from the movie. This version is much more violent and the 
     affective relation between Leon and Mathilda shows no more 
     ambiguities. In this version, Mathilda was to be aged 13 or 
     14

     ** * * * * * * * * *

     Leon and Mathilda arrive on the roof of a building which 
     faces Central Park. They get close to a wall and maintain this 
     position. Sunlight floods the park.

                               LEON(concentrated)
               Firstly, you look. For more than one 
               minute. Because there are alarm systems 
               with one minute period.  Therefore, you 
               wait and look.  Alarms firstly, the sky

My Girl


                               My Girl 2 

                             By Janet Kovalcik



       SETTING:  MADISON, PENNYSYLVANIA 1974


       CLOSE-UP OF VADA SULTENFUSS' FACE

                                   VADA
              I remember before I was born, wounded up like 
              a fur ball in the highly overrated fetal 
              position, luckily I'm not claustrophobic, but 
              on rainy days I still feel a tightness in my 
              left shoulder. So now that my stepmother's 
              pregnant, I understand what the baby's going 
              through, and I'm not jealous at all, really, 
              not at all.

       VIEW OF THE SULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE. VADA, HARRY AND 
       SHELLY ARE SEATED. SHELLY IS VERY PREGNANT

                                   HARRY
              Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.

                                   SHELLY
              If I eat it I'll throw up.

Color 1ST ANNIVERSARY BANNERS flap along with swirling dust and bending vegetation
as a HELICOPTER touches down on the CHEMCO grounds, within its tall fences, near
its administration building. 

The banner reads 

			CHEMCO MALAYSIA--1ST ANNIVERSARY
			  This is just the beginning.

CHEMCO EXECUTIVES are eagerly standing by with a handful of uniformed SECURITY
PEOPLE, keeping a respectful distance.

A MALE SPOKESPERSON, well groomed and David Duke-plastic-surgery handsome, talks
into a wireless mike, ADDRESSING THE CAMERA as his THREE-MAN CREW tapes.  He walks
toward the front entrance--

EXT COASTAL ROAD - NIGHT

OPEN on a highway road in a remote coastal town.  We see CAR HEADLIGHTS 
approach,
and we see it's a CONVERTIBLE with the top down, an old 60's sportscar, beat-up but
cool.  

The driver is JIM TRUDELL; he winds his way down the road.
He's in good shape, and carries the look of a man who has seen and done much in his
32 years.  

The road is desolate, except for a lone ROADHOUSE BAR up in the distance.  Jim sees
it and heads toward it - 

										CUT TO
EXT ROADHOUSE BAR - NIGHT

As Jim approaches it we see the lot littered with bikers and Harleys - regulars.

Jim slows down and pulls up into the driveway - 

We see two large men, LURCH and WEENER, stagger out the front door.  They are very
drunk and looking for trouble"

Transcribed Script
The following is a rough script of the 10th Anniversary version of the movie, as pieced together by me using 
(1) the DVD subtitles, (2) the CD lyrics booklet, (3) the official novelisation and (4) my ears. Massive thanks 
to Jackie (aka Ainaweth) for looking this script over and correcting what needed to be corrected. All other 
mistakes are my own, additional corrections are most welcome.

[Opening transitions: Exterior, London docks, day.]

ENGLISH CHORUS
In sixteen hundred seven
We sail the open sea
For glory, God and gold
And the Virginia Company
For the New World is like heaven
And well all be rich and free
Or so we have been told 
By the Virginia Company
So we have been told
By the Virginia Company
For glory, God and gold
And the Virginia Company

	The cigar shop from within. Displays of cigar boxes, a wall of

                                       FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

                                             October 6, 1995




EXT.  HIGHWAY.  AFTERNOON.

A ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late
afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold,
headlights blazing, powers directly for us.

CUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward
the sedan.

WIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing.

TIGHT ON: The sedan.

TIGHT ON: The pickup.

Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a
deafening cacophony of noise.

INT.  TRUCK.  AFTERNOON.

TIGHT ON: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the
disappearing sedan.

                         GREGORY
            A dog of the house of Capulet moves
            me!

He and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, SAMPSON,
explode with laughter.

  HorrorLair - Alien Resurrection Script






















Alien Resurrection 



EXT.  DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK.

We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes 
into view:

the U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically 
just beyond Pluto's orbit.

We TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and 

INT.  AURIGA

along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two 
guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful 
shockrifles, expressions empty and cold.

INT.  MEDLAB

Along a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, 
lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. 

As we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, 
then another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a 
Cryogenic tube, not big enough for a human.

Still TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass 
encased in a clear, aspic-like gel.

               THE BIG LEBOWSKI

               We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices 
               gently singing ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" and a deep, affable, 
               Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

                                     VOICE-OVER
                         A way out west there was a fella, 
                         fella I want to tell you about, fella 
                         by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At 
                         least, that was the handle his lovin' 
                         parents gave him, but he never had 
                         much use for it himself.  This 
                         Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.  
                         Now, Dude, that's a name no one would 
                         self-apply where I come from.  But 
                         then, there was a lot about the Dude 
                         that didn't make a whole lot of sense

"THE LOST WORLD
 JURASSIC PARK

Screenplay by
David Koepp

based on the novel by
Michael Crichton

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

				MRS. B"

Over the various images of Burnfield's strip malls and fast food

GENE PITNEY (V.O.)

""When your young and so in love as we 
and bewildered by the world we see
why do people hurt us so
Only those in love know
What a town without pity can do
If we stop to gave upon a star
people talk about how bad we are
ours is not an easy age
we're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do""

"BOND 18

Screenplay

by

Bruce Feirstein

(for educational purposes only)


FADE IN ON:

EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN

Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN

We're looking down at what used to be called ""The End of the Known
World."" A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.

In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.

Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
over a cliff:

AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.

Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
the ice. A human figure. This is:

JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.

Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -

CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks
below. Regaining his foothold, Bond"

Trust your heart, let fate decide 
To guide these lives we see 

A paradise untouched by man 
Within this world, blessed with love 
A simple life, they live in peace 

Softly tread the sand below your feet now 
Two worlds one family 
Trust your heart, let fate decide 
To guide these lives we see 

Beneath the shelter of the trees 
Only love can enter here 
A simple life, they live in peace 

Raise your head up, lift high the load 
Take strength from those that need you 
Build high the walls, build strong the beams 
A new life is waiting, but danger's no stranger here 

No words describe a mothe"

            FADE IN ON:

            Black screen

            SOUND OS -- a CHOKED BACK BREATH, GASPING, lungs looking for
            air, the struggle for life and we --

            INT. LIMBO/WATER - ANOTHER TIME

            GASPING for BREATH continues, more relentless, harder,
            heavier and into the FRAME we SEE fragments, slowed into
            special motion, dreamlike, surreal:

            Dirty blonde hair lifts and tumbles; 

            Bubbles POP through the murky water; 

            A hand and then its attached arm swims, in trouble, trying to
            climb;

            And then floats as if disembodied, momentary;

            The SWIMMER drifts, then a brief effort twisting, signs of
            struggle;

            A leg pushes off the nothingness, threatened, an impossible

This portion of the screenplay is originally pages 14-26.  It is presented 
out of order to reflect the final film.

EXT. GARDEN STATE PARKWAY - NIGHT

Three luxury buses with blacked-out windows speed toward
Atlantic City.  A laser show explodes off of Trump Plaza.

INT. BUS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

SETH DAVIS stares out the window.

Seth is 20 years old.  No menacing physical presence but a
sharpness that you feel right off.  He's a smart kid.
Confident but edgy.  Eyes always darting.

The bus is filled with 19 and 20 year olds.  They wear very
sharp suits: Hugo Boss, Armani, very slick.

They're going nuts.  Cards games in the aisle.  Five guys
throwing dice in the back.  Booze and coke, yell"

Identity Read the complete shooting draft in pdf format
April 1, 2002 green revised draft.  Screenplay by Michael Cooney (revisions by James Mangold)

IMDB Info
Official Site

Synopsis: Strangers from all different walks of life: a limo driver escorting a movie star, parents with a young son, a cop transporting a convict, a prostitute, a young couple, and a motel manager are caught up in a nasty rainstorm, stuck at a motel in desolate Nevada. Soon they realize they may be at the motel for another reason when one by one, people start getting killed off. As tensions flare and fingers are pointed, they have to get to the bottom of why they're there. Meanwhile in an undisclosed location, a psychiatrist is trying to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder in an eleventh hour trial. How these two through-lines are related can only be found in Identity.

               except for an incongruously heroic score.

               The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with 
               the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film 
               rather than a feature.

		cancer, muscula"

                                             OVER BLACK:
 
A WHISPER OF VOICES, barely audible at first. Confessional,

My Pure Joy READ the script
Undated, Unspecified draft script by James Cullen Bressack

IMDB Info

Synopsis: On the outside Adam appears to be a normal teenager, but underneath...his mind has been so rotted by trauma from his past and the gory films he watches, that he has blurred the lines between reality and pretend! This prompts Adam to start killing people in similar ways to films he watches, making sure to put his own little spin on it.
